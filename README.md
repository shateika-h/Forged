**Beauty is found even in the ugliest and darkest of places—the light always outshines the darkness.**

Forged is a holistic life management app, inspired by resilience and love. Born at 2lbs 11oz and told I wouldn’t survive, I am here 33 years later to spread hope and encouragement. My goal is to help others find balance, peace, tranquility, and discipline in their everyday lives.

Forged is designed for everyone—those seeking more discipline, structure, focus, spiritual grounding, financial support, or simply a little encouragement. This app is built with love so no one ever feels alone.

## Vision

- **Balance:** Time and financial management, debt payoff tools, and bill tracking.
- **Wellness:** Prioritize mental and physical health through journaling, mood tracking, and guided support.
- **Spirituality:** Promote time with God, daily devotionals, and reflection.
- **Personalization:** Users customize colors, photos, and dashboard features to fit their own needs and style.
- **Accessibility:** Available on web, iOS, Android—easy for anyone, including elders, to use.
- **Community:** Encouragement and resources, with collaborators welcome as long as the vision and integrity are preserved.
